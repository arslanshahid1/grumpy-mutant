        Crypto Enthusiasts, art passionates and game nerds, we gathered funds from family and
        friends to launch a project that showcases our art in a way that allows individuals to
        express themselves. We want to create a space where anyone battling depression, suicidal
        thoughts or any kind of mental health issues can feel safe to express themselves.
        Ultimately, community, passion, and creativity are the main reasons we created The Grumpy
        Mutants. Aside from the play-to-earn game that will be released, future IRL utility and the
        metaverse will be unlocked by the community through roadmap activation and voting.
